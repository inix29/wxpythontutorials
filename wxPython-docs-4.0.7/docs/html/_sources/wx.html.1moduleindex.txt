**wx.html**
=========================================================================

This module contains a widget class and supporting classes for a generic HTML
renderer.  It supports only a subset of the HTML standards, and no Javascript
or CSS, but it is relatively lightweight and has no platform dependencies.  It
is suitable for displaying simple HTML documents, such as the application's
documentation or built-in help pages.

.. note:: Due to some internal dynamic initialization in wxWidgets, this
          module should be imported **before** the :class:`wx.App` object is
          created.
